                <strong>Real Madrid</strong> are gearing up for a fully packed schedule in the build-up to Christmas, facing nine games, seven of which come away from the Bernabéu,
                 following November's international break. The first clash comes against Leganés at Butarque next Sunday, 24 November (6:30pm CET). Three days later, the Champions League throws up a trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool on matchday five.

                <strong>Seven games in December</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next up, on 1 December, will be Getafe's visit to the Bernabéu on LaLiga matchday 15. That marks the beginning of the final month of 2024, with Ancelotti's boys set to play seven games. The next fixture comes against Athletic Club at San Mamés, on Wednesday, 4 December, on the game that has been brought forward to account for the Spanish Super Cup. On Saturday 7, it's back on the road in LaLiga, this time in Girona. On Tuesday 10, the European champions play in the Champions League once again, this time facing Atalanta in Bergamo.

            <p><strong>Intercontinental Cup clash</strong></p>
            <p>
                Prior to the Christmas break, <strong>Real Madrid</strong>  still have another three games to come through, two in LaLiga. The first comes in Vallecas against Rayo (13/14/15 December). On Wednesday 18, our team will be hoping to get their hands on the Intercontinental Cup against opposition that has yet to be decided. Their final game of the year will be at the Bernabéu against Sevilla, on matchday 18 in the league (21/22/23 December).
